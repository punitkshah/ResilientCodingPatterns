# Timeout and Cancellation Pattern - C# Implementation

This example demonstrates the implementation of the Timeout and Cancellation Pattern in C#.

## Overview

The Timeout and Cancellation Pattern is essential for creating resilient applications that can properly handle lengthy operations. It allows applications to:
- Abort operations that take too long to complete
- Respond to user-initiated cancellation
- Gracefully clean up resources when operations are cancelled

## Key Concepts

1. **Timeouts**: Automatically cancel operations that exceed a predefined duration
2. **User Cancellation**: Allow users to cancel long-running operations
3. **Composite Cancellation**: Combine multiple cancellation sources (timeout + user cancellation)
4. **Cooperative Cancellation**: Properly handle cancellation with resource cleanup

## Implementation Details

This example demonstrates:

- Using `CancellationTokenSource` and `CancellationToken` for timeouts
- Implementing user-initiated cancellation
- Creating linked cancellation tokens
- Properly handling cancellation with cleanup

## Running the Example

```bash
dotnet run
```
