# Resilience Fundamentals - C# Implementation

This example demonstrates the core fundamentals of resilient application design in C#.

## Overview

Resilience fundamentals are the building blocks for creating robust applications that can handle failures gracefully. This sample covers essential resilience concepts that form the foundation for more specialized resilience patterns.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Basic Error Handling**: Using try-catch-finally blocks effectively
2. **Asynchronous Error Handling**: Managing exceptions in asynchronous code with cancellation tokens
3. **Health Monitoring**: Implementing component health checks for system monitoring
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Using fallback mechanisms when primary functionality fails

## Implementation Details

The sample demonstrates:

- Proper exception handling with specific and general catch blocks
- Using cancellation tokens for timeout handling
- Creating a reusable health monitoring system
- Implementing multiple fallback levels for critical operations

## Running the Example

```bash
dotnet run
```
