# Timeout and Cancellation Pattern - TypeScript Implementation

This example demonstrates the implementation of the Timeout and Cancellation Pattern in TypeScript.

## Overview

The Timeout and Cancellation Pattern is essential for creating resilient applications that can properly handle lengthy operations. It allows applications to:
- Abort operations that take too long to complete
- Respond to user-initiated cancellation
- Gracefully clean up resources when operations are cancelled

## Key Concepts

1. **Timeouts**: Automatically cancel operations that exceed a predefined duration
2. **User Cancellation**: Allow users to cancel long-running operations
3. **AbortController/AbortSignal**: Standard browser API for cancellation
4. **Composite Cancellation**: Combine multiple cancellation sources
5. **Cleanup**: Properly release resources after cancellation

## Implementation Details

This example demonstrates:

- Using `AbortController` and `AbortSignal` for cancellation
- Implementing user-initiated cancellation
- Using the `p-timeout` library for Promise timeouts
- Cancellable HTTP requests with Axios
- Creating composite cancellation signals

## Running the Example

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the example
npm start
```
